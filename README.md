# Java-Architecture-for-XML-Binding

```
Converting java object into XML --> Marshalling.
Converting of XML into Java Object --> Unmarshalling.
```

## JAXB-API has two versions 1.x and 2.x

`Implementation Steps:`

1. Creating Binding class(Java Bean based class)
2. Define the mapping between java programming elements to XML(we can define it by using JAXB annotations)
3. Write logic for marshalling (OR) for unmarshalling as per the application requirement.
